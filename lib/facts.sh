# lib/facts.sh — the merge door's fact gathering (issue #9).
#
# lib/decide.sh (issue #8) is pure: it consumes four facts and renders the
# 5-state verdict. This script is the impure half that establishes those
# facts. It runs inside the consumer's checkout (the working directory),
# talks to git and gh, and prints the facts in $GITHUB_OUTPUT form:
#
#   ver=…  base_ver=…  released=(yes|no|empty)  labeled=(yes|no|empty)  tag=…
#
# stdout carries exclusively those lines — the release workflow appends the
# whole stream to $GITHUB_OUTPUT — so every diagnostic goes to stderr.
#
# Env in:
#   VERSION_SOURCE      file | package-json (the workflow's one input)
#   TRACK_PATH          the release track's directory (#618); default "."
#   TAG_PREFIX          the release track's tag prefix (#618); default ""
#   MERGE_SHA           the pushed head (github.sha)
#   EVENT_BEFORE        github.event.before — may be empty or all-zeros

#   GH_TOKEN            for gh (unused when no API state is consulted)
#   CEREMONY_LABEL_RETRY_SECONDS  lib/labeled.sh's pause between reads (#628)
#
# The API calls run only in the states that consult them (decide tolerates
# empty facts — issue #8): RELEASED only for a bare unchanged version,
# LABELED only for a bare transition. A -dev tree — every ordinary merge —
# decides on the two versions alone and never touches the API.
